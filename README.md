DriverPass is a client that aims to provide a product for new drivers can access resources and driving instruction to
better prepare them for driving exams. They desired an online based application that could be accessed on any device 
with a internet and a browser, with the option to download educational readings to review while offline. I think 
I did a great job taking the requests made by our client and elevating those requests in the most logical way,
thus maintaining their vision for the product, and using my background and knowledge to improve it. I would like
to revise and add to my class diagram. My first attempt at a class diagram was in part two of this project. I feel
like we had numerous opportunities to practice the other UML diagrams, but that was not the case for the class
diagram. I learned a lot building this one from scratch and would like to adjust and make improvements and additions
to it, but I didn't have time for multiple drafts before project two was due. I learned in this class how important
it is to consider the requests of your client as much as you consider the needs of their user. System design
professionals exist because they are uniquely trained to weigh both of these aspects in their design as it is passed 
to developers. These needs and desires can conflict and it is important to find balance in these aspects so that
neither the vision or customer is negatively impacted by a design choice. It is also vital to keep the security of 
the customer information and business information in mind when making design choices. I like the approach we were led
through in this class, begining with the meeting transcript and building out design from there. Getting to practice 
communication with nontechnical audiences is a vital skill I already use frequently at work and will continue using
and I think it is vital to ensuring that your client feels included and heard throughout the design process.
